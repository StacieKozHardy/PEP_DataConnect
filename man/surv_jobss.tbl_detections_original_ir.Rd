\title{Get JoBSS data: tbl_detections_original_ir}
\usage{
surv_jobss.tbl_detections_original_ir(con)
}
\arguments{
\item{con}{A connection string to the PEP PostgreSQL database}
}
\value{
A data frame object containing all records in the surv_jobss.tbl_detections_original_ir table.
}
\description{
Return all records from surv_jobss.tbl_detections_original_ir as a data frame
}
\details{
This function returns all records in the surv_jobss.tbl_detections_original_ir table. This table contains all the \emph{original} detection outputs from the ice seal ir-rgb trigger detection model
associated with the IR images. This table reflects the original, unreviewed detections.

The detection_id field was created to have a unique identifier assigned to all detections as they related to one another across all detection tables, with the exception of the original_rgb table.
The records in the original_rgb table are different and cannot be linked to the rest of the data without using the surv_jobss.tbl_detections_original2processed_rgb table.
\strong{NOTE}: any records that do not exist in original IR table but exist in any of the processed tables were found and added to the dataset during the review process.

The code used to import these data into the database can be found in the
\href{https://github.com/StacieKozHardy/IceSeal_JoBSS_DataManagement}{IceSeal_JoBSS_DataManagement} repository on GitHub.

The data in this table relate to other JoBSS data based on the following fields:
\itemize{
  \item image_name
  \item detection_id
}
}
\examples{
# Connect to PEP database
con <- pep_connect()

# Get data and do a lot of cool stuff here
data <- surv_jobss.tbl_detections_original_ir(con)

# When you're done, disconnect from the database
pep_disconnect(con)

}
